# AnimatedClock aka Character Clock
This is me learning React Native. I was staring at my Kit-Cat clock, thinking, "What sort of app should I try to make?"

I put together the basic clock watching [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/YBci4HFRQ_c), then started making it my own. 

The vision is to have a clock with a number of animated characters you can select from, or maybe separate apps. 

More as it comes together...
